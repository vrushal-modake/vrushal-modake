<h1>Hi there 👋 I'm Vrushal!</h1>
<h3>Mechanical Engineer | Product Designer</h3>

<p>
For me, design is not just about features in CAD/CAM/CAE tools, it's an attitude of identifying problems and crafting effective, efficient solutions.

<h2>🛠️ Projects & Work</h2>

- <b>Robotic Systems & Mechanism Design</b>  
  - 🐙 [**Multi-Joint “Octopus” Robotic Arm**](https://github.com/vrushal-modake/Robotic-Systems-Mechanism-Design) *(Ongoing)*
    - Designed a multi-joint robotic arm for full 3D workspace with defined joint layout and linkage geometry.  
    - Analyzed lead screw drive and calculated rotation-to-lead conversion. 

- <b>Composite Structures & Simulation</b>  
  - 🧱 [**Carbon-Fiber/ABS Sandwich Beam**](https://github.com/vrushal-modake/Carbon-Fiber-ABS-Sandwich-Beam)
    - Designed a lightweight carbon-fiber/ABS sandwich beam for a 500-lb design load and 1600-lb ultimate load.  
    - Modeled UD-CFRP skins + ABS core in ABAQUS for laminate/core sizing and safety margins.  
    - Built and tested a 3D-printed prototype with load-matched infill, bonded to CFRP face sheets.

- <b>Aircraft Design Projects</b>  
  - ✈️ [**Aerodynamic and Stability Analysis of the Flying Wing**](https://github.com/vrushal-modake/Aerodynamic-and-Stability-Analysis-of-the-Flying-Wing)
    - Designed variable cant-angle wings to enhance low-speed stability and cruise efficiency.  
    - Simulated dynamic-stability effects and mitigated instabilities via elevon trim.  

  - 🛩️ **Tailless Aircraft Prototype**  
    - Led airfoil selection and wing design with ~30% washout to reduce tip-induced drag.  
    - Simulated control surfaces in XFLR5 and optimized for aerodynamic performance and stability.
